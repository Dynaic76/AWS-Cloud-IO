Step 1 :- On AWS Console, Search for EC2 and Click on it. 
  
Step 2 :- Create an ec2 Instance with following configuration:-  
-	Name of Instance :- io-ec2-1077 
-	AMI Image :- Ubuntu –  Instance type :- t2.micro 
-	Key Pair :- Create new key pair or select existing 
-	Network Setting :- Leave all Setting Default 
-	Security Group :- Create a new Allowing SSH & HTTP traffic 
-	Launch the Instance 
 

 
  
Step 3 :- SSH into Your EC2 Instance from the Local Terminal  
1.	Open your Local Terminal and locate your private key file, in this case Downloads folder has the private key file (new.pem) 
2.	Now, used this command to SSH to ec2 instance by aws ssh link or you can also use following command:- - ssh -i “new.pem” ubuntu@57.181.33.179 ( change the IP to your Instance public IP ) 
 

 
 
- Now you have successfully connect to your Instance 
 

3. Install Wget , Unzip, Zip, Apache2 WebServer 
 - sudo apt install wget zip unzip apache2 
  
4. Again, Run sudo systemctl status apache2 ( to check the status ) 
 

  
5. wget the free template from google ( It will downloads the zip of the website template from source ) - wget 
 

 
  
6. Unzip the Website Template file - unzip carint.zip 
  
 

 
7. Go to extracted file  
-	cd carint-html  
-	ls (will show all the files available in that file) 
8. Move all files inside carint-html folder to /var/www/html 
 - sudo mv * /var/www/html 
  
9. Copy the Public Instance Id to the browser to see the Website is working or not, 
 Note :- After this , delete the images inside the /var/www/html/images 
 

 
  
Step 4 :- Create a new Volume & attach it to your Ec2 Instance  

 
1.	Select Gp2 type , 5 gb size & Your availability Zone & create it. 
  
2.	successfully created volume & named it. (volume1) 
  
 

 
3. attach this volume to your ec2 instance 
 
 

 
4. successfully attached the volume 
  
	- 	now from terminal we have to make partition of it and permanently mount it 
Step 5 :- Permanently Mount the EBS Volume  
1) sudo -i (Switch to root user) && fdisk -l (you will see the new volume). 
 

  
2) Make the partition of the new volume 
-	fdisk /dev/xvdf 
-	m 
-	n (for new partition) 
-	p (primary)  
-	First Sector :- press Enter 
-	Last Sector : press Enter 
-	p  
-	w (save & write out) 
 

 
  
3) After Partition is done - fdisk -l (you will see partitioned disk) 
 

 
  
4) Now , make file system - mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf1 
 

 
  
5) Permanently mount 
-	vi /etc/fstab (Editor will open) 
-	Press I for insert mode in Vi editor 
-	Enter the path in editor as shown in following image 
-	Save file & exit (Esc + :wq)  
-	mount –a 
-	df -h ( to see the volume is successfully mounted or not 
 

6) It has been Successfully Mounted and also lost+found folder also appears. 
  
Step 6 :- Take the Snapshot of Volume 
1) Go to Actions , click on create Snapshot 
 
  
2) Create Snapshot. 
 

 
  
3) Unmount our disk 
 
 

 
  
4) Detach the Created Volume: 
 

  
5) Delete the Volume: 
 

 
  
Now Volume has been successfully deleted. 
Step 7 :- Create Volume of the Snapshot 
 

-	You will see new volume has been created.  
-	Attached this backeup volume to our ec2 Instance as 
 Step 4. - fdisk -l ( you will see the partition has been already done as it is a Snapshot.  
-	ls -l ( to check is if our disk is empty) 

  
-	Go to Terminal & mount the backup disk 
-	mount /dev/xvdf1 /var/www/html/images  
-	Now copy the IP of your Instance & paste it to your new browser & you  will see the website will run successfully with Images because the Volume  we created by Snapshot contains the Images . 

 
  
-	After completing this, Delete all the resources your created : 
-	1. Delete Snapshot  
2.	Delete Volume  
3.	Delete Ec2 Instance
